    <section class="aboutme">
      <p>
        My love of code and design coincides with my love of video games. I remember when games used to come with
        instruction
        manuals, I would read each manual front to back multiple times. Inspired by the artwork, time and effort put
        into
        each creation I instantly knew these were my passions.
        â€‹<br><br>
        In coding and design while distinct, my creative approach often involves a sense of play, aiming to put the fun
        in
        functional. Strategically, my work aims to elevate brand offerings by distilling core messaging down to its
        clearest and freshest visual form.
        <br><br>
        I've had a love for design and code since 2002. I learned after middle school of a magnet school, Highland Tech,
        nearby
        that specialized in Web/Graphic Design. After getting my feet wet in high school I knew there was so much more I
        could
        do thus leading me to The Art Institute of Charlotte, where I would acquire an associates for
        Interactive Media Design, broadening my repertoire.
